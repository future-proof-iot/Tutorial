title: Welcome to the IEEE EuroS&P Tutorial on IoT Security with Microcontrollers & RIOT
---

# Tutorial

This tutorial takes place in the context of IEEE EuroS&P. Participants will be led through hands-on activities with IoT on low-power microcontroller-based devices. We will be using [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) with a focus on using the cybersecurity primitives available with this operating system on such low-end IoT hardware (e.g., ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32, AVR, MSP430 microcontrollers).
The tutorial taking place online-only, participants will be provided remote access to an adequate IoT testbed.
