# The IEEE EuroS&P Tutorial on IoT Security with Microcontrollers & RIOT

Participants in this tutorial will be led through hands-on activities with IoT on low-power microcontroller-based devices, using [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) with a focus on using the cybersecurity primitives available with this operating system on such low-end IoT hardware (e.g., ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32, AVR, MSP430 microcontrollers).
