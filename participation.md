title: Welcome to the IEEE EuroS&P Tutorial on IoT Security with Microcontrollers & RIOT
---



## Purpose of the Tutorial

This tutorial introduces hands-on activities with IoT on low-power microcontroller-based devices, using [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) with a focus on using the cybersecurity primitives available with this operating system on such low-end IoT hardware (for instance ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32, AVR, MSP430 microcontrollers).

## Prerequisites for the Tutorial

If you do not like programming, then this tutorial is not for you. Sorry!
Prior to attending, please go through these [preparation steps](preparation).
