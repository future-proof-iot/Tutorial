title: Welcome to the IEEE EuroS&P Tutorial on IoT Security with Microcontrollers & RIOT
---



## Purpose of the Tutorial

This tutorial introduces hands-on activities with IoT on low-power microcontroller-based devices, using [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT) with a focus on using the cybersecurity primitives available with this operating system on such low-end IoT hardware (for instance ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP32, AVR, MSP430 microcontrollers).

## Tutorial Workflow

The workflow of the tutorial is described [here](https://riot-os.github.io/riot-course/slides/tutorial-summit-security/).

## Prerequisites for the Tutorial

There is no specific setup you need to take care of prior to the tutorial.
We will use only in-browser tools.

However, if you do not like programming, then this tutorial is not for you. Sorry!

## Register for the Tutorial

Participation at the tutorial requires registration. Please register at [IEEE EuroS&P](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2020/).
