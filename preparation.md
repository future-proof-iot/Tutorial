# Preparatory Steps


We will use [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT).
RIOT is an open source, real-time, multi-threading operating system
which supports a range of devices typically found in the Internet of Things,
based on various 32-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit microcontrollers.

For the tutorial we will use a preconfigured virtual
machine.
Please download and test-run the VM before the tutorial by following these [instructions & prerequisites](https://github.com/future-proof-iot/RIOT/wiki/SUIT-Tutorial-and-Hackathon-Berlin-2020).
