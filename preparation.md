title: Welcome to the IEEE EuroS&P Tutorial on IoT Security with Microcontrollers & RIOT
---

# Preparatory Steps


## Background

We will use [RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT).
RIOT is an open source, real-time, multi-threading operating system
which supports a range of devices typically found in the Internet of Things,
based on various 32-bit, 16-bit or 8-bit microcontrollers.
For a quick introduction to RIOT your can refer to this [documentation](https://doc.riot-os.org/) and to this recent [IEEE IoT Journal article](https://riot-os.org/docs/riot-ieeeiotjournal-2018.pdf) providing a high-level overview.


## Setup & Workflow
No preliminary setup is necessary.
We will provide [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) accessible directly through your web browser, to interact with a large-scale open-access remote testbed [FIT IoT-Lab](https://www.iot-lab.info/).
Via these Jupyter notebooks you will write code, cross-compile it, and run it on real hardware -- including on low-power microcontroller-based devices.
